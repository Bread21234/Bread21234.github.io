	<h1>Plan for the Future</h1>
	<p class="p1Container p1Style">
	  Currently, I plan on majoring in computer science and minoring in data science. I am really facinated with artifical intelligence and I hope to one day become a machine learning engineer. If I do not do computer science, I will either major in chemical or nuclear engineering. For now, I want to make the most of my senior year by being involved and learning as much as I can.

	<h1>Hobbies</h1>
	<p class="p1Container p1Style">My free time is often spent with music in some aspect. I am a huge saxophone enthusiast, so much of my time is devoted to that. I play both alto and soprano saxophone both in solos and in small ensembles. Currently, I am in a saxophone ensemble and quartet. Some of my other hobbies include videogames. I am a big fan of the fighting game genre with games like Guilty Gear Strive and MOBA's like League of Legends. One of my favorite games of all time is Super Smash Bros Ultimate in which I participated in competitive tounraments.
