      <p>Chegg is an American education technology company based in
	Santa Clara, California. It provides homework help and many other
	student services by using experts in the feilds to give accurate
    answers and explanations. Recently, Chegg's stock has rapidly
	declined at an alarming rate. The reason for this is not that
	Chegg no longer has what students want, but rather the creation of
	ChatGPT. ChatGPT is an open source AI chatbot that can quickly
	give answers and responses to students tailored to their specific
	needs. BNot only is ChatGPT free, but its responsses are
	specifically designed for the student's question. As a result,
	many students have simply preferred te use of ChatGPT. Moreover,
    with ChatGPT, the user has the ability to ask for clarification on
	certain areas of ChatGPT's original answer which ChatGPT will
	respond to IMMEDIETELY. Rather than having to wait for an expert
	answer from Chegg, ChatGPT is able to create a personalized
	experience for each user. The creation of ChatGPT has destroyed
	Chegg's stock value.</p>
