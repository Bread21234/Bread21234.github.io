    <p>Chegg is an American education technology company based in Santa Clara, California. It provides homework help and many other student services by using experts in the feilds to give accurate answers and explanations. Recently, Chegg's stock has rapidly declined at an alarming rate. The reason for this is not that Chegg no longer has what students want, but rather the creation of ChatGPT. ChatGPT is an open source AI chatbot that can quickly give answers and responses to students tailored to their specific needs. BNot only is ChatGPT free, but its responsses are specifically designed for the student's question. As a result, many students have simply preferred te use of ChatGPT. Moreover, with ChatGPT, the user has the ability to ask for clarification on certain areas of ChatGPT's original answer which ChatGPT will respond to IMMEDIETELY. Rather than having to wait for an expert answer from Chegg, ChatGPT is able to create a personalized experience for each user. The creation of ChatGPT has destroyed Chegg's stock value.</p>
