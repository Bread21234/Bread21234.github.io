	    <h1>What Have I Learned In the Last Year of CS?</h1>
	    <p>In regards, I have gained a tremendous number of skills in the past year alone. For instance, I learned what classes were and how I could use them to organize my code. I learned how to use html, css, and javascript to create a website for the arena scheduling app. One of my favorite skills I gained last year was the ability to use Unity and C# to create a functioning videogame. Beyond computer science, I learned crucial leadership skills from being a part of groups throughout the year.  </p>
