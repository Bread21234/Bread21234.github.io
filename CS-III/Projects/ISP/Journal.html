      <h1>Roles</h1>
      <p><u>Development Engineer:</u>The development engineer’s primary responsibility is to conceptualize, design, and determine how a product will
	be coded. Additionally, it is the responsibility of the development engineer to test if the product is doing what it is designed for and that
	it meets the criteria set by the product manager. Personally, I feel I would be very successful with this role. I have many natural leadership
	qualities and I believe I could create a coherent method of coding the product. The main challenge with this role has to do with people’s
	differing opinions. As everyone is their own individual, they may have different ideas and methods of overcoming a task, so it is crucial that
	the development manager defines a consistent approach to the product.</p>
      <br>
      <p><u>QA Engineer:</u> Otherwise known as the quality assurance engineer, the QA engineer is responsible for ensuring the standard and quality
	of the project. Firstly, the QA engineer must ensure that the product does what it was intended and everything is done efficiently. Then, the
	QA must test for bugs by presenting the product with responses it may not be expecting, attempting to cause the software to fail or
	crash. Then, it can be determined how the product can be improved to avoid those errors, overall increasing the quality of the project. I
	believe that I could be a good quality assurance engineer as I have experience testing my own programs for bugs and patching them. The main
	struggle with this job is actually fixing all the bugs, for it requires a great deal of understanding and knowledge of the product. The best
	way to overcome this is read all of the comments and work through in your head what each part of the code does.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Project manager:</u> For a project such as this, the project manager has many responsibilities. Primarily, the project manager’s
	responsibility is to create a timeline in which the product will be completed on time. In addition, the project manager, along with other
	members of the group, determines which parts of the product are the most valuable and constructs the timeline to fit those needs. Finally, it
	is important that the project manager divides the members of a group and assigns workloads and tasks according to each member’s
	abilities. Personally, I believe that this job is the best suited for me. I am extremely organized and on top of everything scheduling wise,
	so I believe that I could be very successful in this role. The biggest challenge with this job is creating a timeline that is feasible, for it
	is very easy to overestimate what a person can do in a night. To combat this, I often build space into my timelines so that if my group is to
	fall behind, we will still be on schedule.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Product manager:</u> A product manager is a person who identifies the customer need and the larger business objectives that a product or
	feature will fulfill. Then, the product manager articulates their idea to the team, laying out the specifications of what the product will
	have in terms of features. The product manager must also be willing to prioritize certain features over others, requiring sacrifices if the
	team is behind schedule. In general, the goal of the product manager is to define a vision for the product, push the team toward that goal,
	and make important adjustments as needed. For a product manager, I would also be a good fit due to my decisiveness and leadership
	qualities. When it comes to projects such as this, I am very comfortable with communicating my ideas and my vision for the project, so I could
	use those skills to be an effective product manager. The greatest challenge of this role is determining what the priorities of the product are
	and being willing to make the necessary sacrifices to fit time constraints.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Release Engineering:</u> The release engineer’s responsibility is to define all the steps required to release the software/product. For
	instance, the release engineer is in charge of handling how all the source code will be organized in the repository. This includes defining
	what sort of branch strategy will be used and keeping track of each of the branches. Along the journey of the product, it is also the release
	engineer’s job to determine how the deployment will be conducted, meaning they decide which version will be released to be tested and updated
	in the release branch. Due to my organizational skills, I believe I could be an effective release engineer. I have experience with git, and my
	organizational nature would allow me to keep each branch organized and up to date. For me, the greatest challenge is keeping up with every
	branch of the project to ensure that no important changes are overwritten or reverted.

      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>I believe the biggest challange for this project is the fact that everything is entirely new. Not one member of
      the group knows how to utilize cameras as input or employ facial recognition. However, this does bring me some excitement as I love learning new
      things. In order to overcome this challange, I have begun reading articles of how base facial recognition is done and the advantages of
      different methods. I plan to decide on a method which benefits our project the most and then begin with the basics. It will also help to break
      down the milestones into smaller, more digestable milestones to prevent being overwhelmed.</p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>The biggest scheduling challange is the fact that all of us have very different schedules and so there are not
      many times we can all work together outside of class. I do believe this may be beneficial so that none of the members get in the way of
      others. Additionally, scheduking is hard becasue many of the members are busy whether it is with hockey, or tennis, or band, and time lost to
      those activities will need to be accounted for. My first plan to overcome this challange is to first make a discord server where members can
      message eachother about questions or progress updates in order to keep everyone on top of things. Additionally, I would like to plan a few days
      in which all (or at least most) members could join a zoom call online over a weekend to discuss work and work together. </p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>Honestly, I have a pretty good outlook on my group and I believe that we can be successful. Of course, the
      greatest issue is the lack of worth ethic some members may possess. Moreover, people in their final semester of senior year may also not be as
      inclined to work, adding to the lack of work ethic. My plan to overcome this is to create a scrict but adjustable schedule which fits the needs
      and time of each member. Moreover, I plan to assign the most important jobs to those who are truly interested in those concepts, for a worker
      who enjoys their work tends to be the most productive. Lastly, I plan to use the group environment to instantiate a feeling of accountablity so
      that everyone does the work assigned.</p>

      <h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>This week, my team was extremely productive and did not run into many technical challanges. We focussed mostly on
      researching different methods of facial recognition and how we would do it. I think the most daunting part of the project will be making a
      database of faces and names that our project will be able to pull from in order to recognize people. We will most likely need to make an API,
      but we have never done anything like that, so it will be a learning experience.</p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>The most stressful thing schedule-wise is the fact that a lot of final things in relation to college are going
      on right now. For instance, I have many scholarship applications due in the next few weeks so I find myself spending more time on those than on
      this project. However, now that we have begun to lay the groundwork for our ISP, I believe progress will come smoothly.</p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>I felt no huge interpersonal conflicts this week. I think my team is great and will get along just fine. We
      have recently taken on a new student, but they are adapting quickly and I believe will be a great help. We all are very excited about the
      development of our ISP, so I think it will be easy to start working together. If I had to specify any challanges, I still believe some members
      may struggle with work ethic, but I think we will be fine.</p>

      
      <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>I do not feel there were any major issues this week. As a group, we found some really interesting articles that
      have given us an idea of how to recognize faces. There are still some errors currently, but what we have tested so far has been decently
      successful. I think the biggest challange after the actual facial recognition part will be the API. I want to use an API to send faces to/from a
      database but I am not sure how to build or implement one.<br>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>Again, the biggest scheduling challange is just the fact that each member has a lot of other work. As a result,
      no one views a project due in multiple months as a priority. I have made most of a gantt chart to hopefully remedy some of this issue. Also, we
      find it hard to find times to work together and establish a clear plan for the project. Our group is just too big for that.<br>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>There really are not any interpersonal issues per say. If anything, I think the issue is simply that we all
      have different ideas for the project. I think we just all need to sit down together and clearly define what we want to do. So far, we have had
      some conflicts on functionality and how we actually carry things out, so I believe a group session may be the solution we need. Additionally, I
      have made a discord that I hope to outline the project in.</p>
      
            
      <h2>30-Jan-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>The greatest technical challange for me is the use of APIs. I have been doing some research and I feel I have a basic understanding of the concept; however, I am struggling to build one. I need to create a database of faces and names that correspond to students in a class. Additionally, we need to be able to create/edit classes, so we will have to be able to edit the API. The other technical challange is making an account system. We want to have different users with different classes and progress, but we are not quite sure how to do that yet.<br>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>The most scheduling challanges that occur are due to the fact we have limited time together. Last class, we used the time to essentially define every aspect of the project as well as assign priority to certain parts. I have also created a gantt chart to hopefully remedy some of the scheduling issues. However, I think more time in class to discuss some of the methods we want to use could be highly beneficial and ensure that we are all on the same page. <br>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>This week, the group was very helpful and provided a lot of input. Conflicting ideas arose from time to time, but a decision based on popular vote seemed to solve all of those issues. Now, some members can be quite stubborn at times, myself included, but we have been able to find a commonground every time. There are issues with work ethic, but I believe this timeline I have build will help get us on track. I think the project was just a lot so no one knew where to start. </p>
