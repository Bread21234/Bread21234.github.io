      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>This week, Oliver and I accomplished a lot in regards to the database. We have created a bunch of functions for
      use and have a great understanding of what to do next. However, we have been having an error where the functions cannot find a specific photo
      file when we try to add the database to the other file. To clarify, when there are other files in completely separate parent folders, the
      functions are not running despite having not been changed from before. I will keep looking for the issue I think it is something small. </p>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>The greatest scheduling challange was all of the after school things happening this week. There was the talent
      show, I had some band things, and some students are out for sports. I wanted to talk to those people specifically so it is kind of unlucky that
      they are not here. I am glad that the ISP is starting to pick up pace; I only hope that I can get ahead on other classes so I can truly sit down
      and grind computer science.</p>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>There have been no huge interpersonal issues. There are clearly some students who do not care as much and are
      not affected whether the project goes well or not, but that is to be expected. I am really happy with a majority of my group who truly cares and
      is putting in the work. I need to begin assigning more work to make sure some other parts of the project get done, but other than that
      everything is going pretty well.</p>


      
      <h2>27-Feb-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>Most technical challanges I encountered this week were related to SQLite. Now, I am able to insert and read BLOB
	data. My next challange has been storing data into specific databases and tables to later be used. I need to format the databases so that each
	user has their own which includes tables of each class. This has been the most difficult thing thus far I have been working on. On the bright
	side, I believe I have found a way to make different users and differentiate their classes. The only issue is I am still stuck on how to build
	new accounts. However, that is not a priority at the moment.</p>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>This week was an odd one for scheduling. The SAT wednesday and half-day Friday have really thrown a wrench into
	my scheduling. However, we will make due. I just need to insure I tell everyone what is expected of them as we move into the 4th nine
	weeks. Personally, I plan on working over the break to build an MVP that is closer to our final product. Cameron has worked a lot on the front
	end so I believe I can begin to add more functionality to it.</p>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>The only issue I notice is people do not ask for help when they get stuck. Instead, they choose not to work
	and expect someone else to do it for them. I hope to establish some sort of drive to get them to want to work on the project. I believe we have
	a lot of potential and a lot of very smart students, so I want to see how far we can go. Other than that, my team gets along very well; everyone
	is friendly with one another and there are not arguemnts. If I were to give something minor, it can be sometimes hard to work with people
	outside of the class, but the ones in our group and doing great so far.</p>

      <h2>20-Feb-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>This week, I have worked mostly on building a database for our website. After trying researching a dozen
	different types of databases and wheighing my options, I tried to build one using SQL and a SQL server. However, I was not able to host a SQL
	server and so I kept running into issues. Instead, I have decided to use SQLite which is a C library I can use with Python. So far, I have had
	a decent amount of success with it and I am now working on figuring out how to blob data in order to get images. I have been able to put them
	into the database, but I am still working on reading them. If you have any tips or alternatives, let me know please.</p>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>The only real scheduling challange was that there were two fewer days in the school week, meaning we only got
	one B day. I do not feel I did a good enough job of assigning what needs to be done over the next week, but I can use the discord for that. I
	feel an additional day in class would have been very beneficial because I could explain to my group what I had been working on and how it
	would impact creating a large portion of the websites functionality.</p>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>In class this week, my team and I debated color schemes. Personally, I was not a fan of the cyan and yellow,
	but Cameron is in charge of designing the front end so it should be up to him. I voiced my opinion, and we all discussed different color
	schemes we could use. I feel I may have come off to pushy but that was not how I meant it. Besides that, we had some members out this week
	that I wanted to speak to about the next part of the project because I believe they will play a big part in it. Additionally, I notice some
	students (including me sometimes) put the ISP on the backburner due to the seemingly far away due date which can be stressful.</p>

      <h2>13-Feb-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>This greatest challange I have had this week is utilizing Flask. I am using Visual Studio Code and I am having a
	lot of issues attempting to make a virtual environment. I am trying to use flask in order to test my API. I am learning a lot; however I have
	been very stumped on what I am working on. Also, I do not know exactly what I need the API to do, for my knowledge is very limited.</p>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>The greatest scheduling challanges I have had so far is the nine weeks is ending soon, so there are a lot of
	quizzes happening. Additionally, I was out of town this past weekend for a funeral and was not able to work then. Hopefully, I will be able to
	get some work done this weekend with the extended break.</p>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>I have been struggling to find people that want to actually work on their part. This past week, we have
	really gotten a start on the project and have a good vision for what our project will be, so I hope that things will begin pick up the pace. I
	have divided the work among different sections of the project such as UI, face-recognition, account system, and API, so I hope that puts a
	little more individual responsibility on everyone.</p>


      <h2>06-Feb-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>Again, the greatest technical challange currently is the API. We do not know whether to use two or one at the
	moment but right now we're just working to make one. Also, we are going to have to look through last year's modle schedular to figure out a
	way to link the API with the application. Another technical issue is with our facial recognition software. We do not know the best way to
	implement it which maximizes speed and memory. I think it will simply require testing once we get things mostly working.</p>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>Until the project is compeletly underway, it is impossible to create accurate guesses of how long each part of
	the ISP will take. For instance, since my group and I have not worked with making an account database for storing multiple users, we do not
	know exactly how to do it. I have put together a schedule to the best of my ability thus far, but I will need to make constant
	updates. Luckily, I built in time for the event where my team inevitably falls "behind".</p>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>This week, there are little to no interpersonal challanges. I have set up a discord and organized it on the
	different aspects of our ISP. The most important thing now is that the people in charge of each area effectively communicate what they want
	the workers to do. For instance, Cameron is in charge of directing the UI and he needs to communicate to the others working on the UI his
	exact approach. So far, he has done a great job.</p>

      
      <h2>30-Jan-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>The greatest technical challange for me is the use of APIs. I have been doing some research and I feel I have a
	basic understanding of the concept; however, I am struggling to build one. I need to create a database of faces and names that correspond to
	students in a class. Additionally, we need to be able to create/edit classes, so we will have to be able to edit the API. The other technical
	challange is making an account system. We want to have different users with different classes and progress, but we are not quite sure how to
	do that yet.</p>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>The most scheduling challanges that occur are due to the fact we have limited time together. Last class, we used
	the time to essentially define every aspect of the project as well as assign priority to certain parts. I have also created a gantt chart to
	hopefully remedy some of the scheduling issues. However, I think more time in class to discuss some of the methods we want to use could be
	highly beneficial and ensure that we are all on the same page.</p>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>This week, the group was very helpful and provided a lot of input. Conflicting ideas arose from time to time,
	but a decision based on popular vote seemed to solve all of those issues. Now, some members can be quite stubborn at times, myself included,
	but we have been able to find a commonground every time. There are issues with work ethic, but I believe this timeline I have build will help
	get us on track. I think the project was just a lot so no one knew where to start. </p>


      
      <h2>23-Jan-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>I do not feel there were any major issues this week. As a group, we found some really interesting articles that
	have given us an idea of how to recognize faces. There are still some errors currently, but what we have tested so far has been decently
	successful. I think the biggest challange after the actual facial recognition part will be the API. I want to use an API to send faces to/from
	a database but I am not sure how to build or implement one.</p>
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>Again, the biggest scheduling challange is just the fact that each member has a lot of other work. As a result,
	no one views a project due in multiple months as a priority. I have made most of a gantt chart to hopefully remedy some of this issue. Also,
	we find it hard to find times to work together and establish a clear plan for the project. Our group is just too big for that.</p>
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>There really are not any interpersonal issues per say. If anything, I think the issue is simply that we all
	have different ideas for the project. I think we just all need to sit down together and clearly define what we want to do. So far, we have had
	some conflicts on functionality and how we actually carry things out, so I believe a group session may be the solution we need. Additionally,
	I have made a discord that I hope to outline the project in.</p>

      <h2>16-Jan-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>This week, my team was extremely productive and did not run into many technical challanges. We focussed mostly on
	researching different methods of facial recognition and how we would do it. I think the most daunting part of the project will be making a
	database of faces and names that our project will be able to pull from in order to recognize people. We will most likely need to make an API,
	but we have never done anything like that, so it will be a learning experience.</p>
      
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>The most stressful thing schedule-wise is the fact that a lot of final things in relation to college are going
	on right now. For instance, I have many scholarship applications due in the next few weeks so I find myself spending more time on those than
	on this project. However, now that we have begun to lay the groundwork for our ISP, I believe progress will come smoothly.</p>
      
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>I felt no huge interpersonal conflicts this week. I think my team is great and will get along just fine. We
	have recently taken on a new student, but they are adapting quickly and I believe will be a great help. We all are very excited about the
	development of our ISP, so I think it will be easy to start working together. If I had to specify any challanges, I still believe some members
	may struggle with work ethic, but I think we will be fine.</p>

      
      <h2>9-Jan-2023</h2>
      <h1>Challanges</h1>
      <p><u>Technical Challanges:</u>I believe the biggest challange for this project is the fact that everything is entirely new. Not one member of
	the group knows how to utilize cameras as input or employ facial recognition. However, this does bring me some excitement as I love learning
	new things. In order to overcome this challange, I have begun reading articles of how base facial recognition is done and the advantages of
	different methods. I plan to decide on a method which benefits our project the most and then begin with the basics. It will also help to break
	down the milestones into smaller, more digestable milestones to prevent being overwhelmed.</p>
      
      <p><u>Scheduling Challanges:</u>The biggest scheduling challange is the fact that all of us have very different schedules and so there are not
	many times we can all work together outside of class. I do believe this may be beneficial so that none of the members get in the way of
	others. Additionally, scheduking is hard becasue many of the members are busy whether it is with hockey, or tennis, or band, and time lost to
	those activities will need to be accounted for. My first plan to overcome this challange is to first make a discord server where members can
	message eachother about questions or progress updates in order to keep everyone on top of things. Additionally, I would like to plan a few
	days in which all (or at least most) members could join a zoom call online over a weekend to discuss work and work together. </p>
      
      <p><u>Interpersonal Challanges:</u>Honestly, I have a pretty good outlook on my group and I believe that we can be successful. Of course, the
	greatest issue is the lack of worth ethic some members may possess. Moreover, people in their final semester of senior year may also not be as
	inclined to work, adding to the lack of work ethic. My plan to overcome this is to create a scrict but adjustable schedule which fits the
	needs and time of each member. Moreover, I plan to assign the most important jobs to those who are truly interested in those concepts, for a
	worker who enjoys their work tends to be the most productive. Lastly, I plan to use the group environment to instantiate a feeling of
	accountablity so that everyone does the work assigned.</p>
      


      <h2>2-Jan-2023</h2>
      <h1>Roles</h1>
      <p><u>Development Engineer:</u>The development engineer’s primary responsibility is to conceptualize, design, and determine how a product will
	be coded. Additionally, it is the responsibility of the development engineer to test if the product is doing what it is designed for and that
	it meets the criteria set by the product manager. Personally, I feel I would be very successful with this role. I have many natural leadership
	qualities and I believe I could create a coherent method of coding the product. The main challenge with this role has to do with people’s
	differing opinions. As everyone is their own individual, they may have different ideas and methods of overcoming a task, so it is crucial that
	the development manager defines a consistent approach to the product.</p>
      
      <p><u>QA Engineer:</u> Otherwise known as the quality assurance engineer, the QA engineer is responsible for ensuring the standard and quality
	of the project. Firstly, the QA engineer must ensure that the product does what it was intended and everything is done efficiently. Then, the
	QA must test for bugs by presenting the product with responses it may not be expecting, attempting to cause the software to fail or
	crash. Then, it can be determined how the product can be improved to avoid those errors, overall increasing the quality of the project. I
	believe that I could be a good quality assurance engineer as I have experience testing my own programs for bugs and patching them. The main
	struggle with this job is actually fixing all the bugs, for it requires a great deal of understanding and knowledge of the product. The best
	way to overcome this is read all of the comments and work through in your head what each part of the code does.
      </p>
      
      <p><u>Project manager:</u> For a project such as this, the project manager has many responsibilities. Primarily, the project manager’s
	responsibility is to create a timeline in which the product will be completed on time. In addition, the project manager, along with other
	members of the group, determines which parts of the product are the most valuable and constructs the timeline to fit those needs. Finally, it
	is important that the project manager divides the members of a group and assigns workloads and tasks according to each member’s
	abilities. Personally, I believe that this job is the best suited for me. I am extremely organized and on top of everything scheduling wise,
	so I believe that I could be very successful in this role. The biggest challenge with this job is creating a timeline that is feasible, for it
	is very easy to overestimate what a person can do in a night. To combat this, I often build space into my timelines so that if my group is to
	fall behind, we will still be on schedule.
      </p>
      
      <p><u>Product manager:</u> A product manager is a person who identifies the customer need and the larger business objectives that a product or
	feature will fulfill. Then, the product manager articulates their idea to the team, laying out the specifications of what the product will
	have in terms of features. The product manager must also be willing to prioritize certain features over others, requiring sacrifices if the
	team is behind schedule. In general, the goal of the product manager is to define a vision for the product, push the team toward that goal,
	and make important adjustments as needed. For a product manager, I would also be a good fit due to my decisiveness and leadership
	qualities. When it comes to projects such as this, I am very comfortable with communicating my ideas and my vision for the project, so I could
	use those skills to be an effective product manager. The greatest challenge of this role is determining what the priorities of the product are
	and being willing to make the necessary sacrifices to fit time constraints.
      </p>
      
      <p><u>Release Engineering:</u> The release engineer’s responsibility is to define all the steps required to release the software/product. For
	instance, the release engineer is in charge of handling how all the source code will be organized in the repository. This includes defining
	what sort of branch strategy will be used and keeping track of each of the branches. Along the journey of the product, it is also the release
	engineer’s job to determine how the deployment will be conducted, meaning they decide which version will be released to be tested and updated
	in the release branch. Due to my organizational skills, I believe I could be an effective release engineer. I have experience with git, and my
	organizational nature would allow me to keep each branch organized and up to date. For me, the greatest challenge is keeping up with every
	branch of the project to ensure that no important changes are overwritten or reverted.
