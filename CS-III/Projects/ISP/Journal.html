      <h1>Roles</h1>
      <p><u>Development Engineer:</u>The development engineer’s primary responsibility is to
	conceptualize, design, and determine how a product will be coded. Additionally, it is the
	responsibility of the development engineer to test if the product is doing what it is designed
	for and that it meets the criteria set by the product manager. Personally, I feel I would be
	very successful with this role. I have many natural leadership qualities and I believe I could
	create a coherent method of coding the product. The main challenge with this role has to do
	with people’s differing opinions. As everyone is their own individual, they may have different
	ideas and methods of overcoming a task, so it is crucial that the development manager defines
	a consistent approach to the product.</p>
      <br>
      <p><u>QA Engineer:</u> Otherwise known as the quality assurance engineer, the QA engineer is
	responsible for ensuring the standard and quality of the project. Firstly, the QA engineer
	must ensure that the product does what it was intended and everything is done
	efficiently. Then, the QA must test for bugs by presenting the product with responses it may
	not be expecting, attempting to cause the software to fail or crash. Then, it can be
	determined how the product can be improved to avoid those errors, overall increasing the
	quality of the project. I believe that I could be a good quality assurance engineer as I have
	experience testing my own programs for bugs and patching them. The main struggle with this job
	is actually fixing all the bugs, for it requires a great deal of understanding and knowledge
	of the product. The best way to overcome this is read all of the comments and work through in
	your head what each part of the code does.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Project manager:</u> For a project such as this, the project manager has many
	responsibilities. Primarily, the project manager’s responsibility is to create a timeline in
	which the product will be completed on time. In addition, the project manager, along with
	other members of the group, determines which parts of the product are the most valuable and
	constructs the timeline to fit those needs. Finally, it is important that the project manager
	divides the members of a group and assigns workloads and tasks according to each member’s
	abilities. Personally, I believe that this job is the best suited for me. I am extremely
	organized and on top of everything scheduling wise, so I believe that I could be very
	successful in this role. The biggest challenge with this job is creating a timeline that is
	feasible, for it is very easy to overestimate what a person can do in a night. To combat this,
	I often build space into my timelines so that if my group is to fall behind, we will still be
	on schedule.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Product manager:</u> A product manager is a person who identifies the customer need and
	the larger business objectives that a product or feature will fulfill. Then, the product
	manager articulates their idea to the team, laying out the specifications of what the product
	will have in terms of features. The product manager must also be willing to prioritize certain
	features over others, requiring sacrifices if the team is behind schedule. In general, the
	goal of the product manager is to define a vision for the product, push the team toward that
	goal, and make important adjustments as needed. For a product manager, I would also be a good
	fit due to my decisiveness and leadership qualities. When it comes to projects such as this, I
	am very comfortable with communicating my ideas and my vision for the project, so I could use
	those skills to be an effective product manager. The greatest challenge of this role is
	determining what the priorities of the product are and being willing to make the necessary
	sacrifices to fit time constraints.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p><u>Release Engineering:</u> The release engineer’s responsibility is to define all the
	steps required to release the software/product. For instance, the release engineer is in
	charge of handling how all the source code will be organized in the repository. This includes
	defining what sort of branch strategy will be used and keeping track of each of the
	branches. Along the journey of the product, it is also the release engineer’s job to determine
	how the deployment will be conducted, meaning they decide which version will be released to be
	tested and updated in the release branch. Due to my organizational skills, I believe I could
	be an effective release engineer. I have experience with git, and my organizational nature
	would allow me to keep each branch organized and up to date. For me, the greatest challenge is
	keeping up with every branch of the project to ensure that no important changes are
	overwritten or reverted.
