      <h1>Eagle Card</h1>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to Proposal</a>
      <p>The Eagle Card is a project which will create a card which would allow the user to swipe it near a device to open a predetermined web-page in
	the browser. I was first enticed by this isp because I find it very unique and I believe a card like the Eagle Card could have uses. However,
	I rejected this project because I overall believe that it would be more cumbersome to use a physical object than to simply type a link. The
	card could be easily replaced with a simple bookmark. </p>

      <h1>AI Chatbot</h1>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/helen-giordano/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to Proposal</a>
      <p>This AI chatbot is designed to help children and teens process their emotions through meaningful dialogue with this chatbot. This project
	sparked my interest because I believe mental health is a very important part of a person’s overall health, and creating a chatbot for that
	would be amazing. Additionally, I would definitely be interested in using AI to create a bot that could respond to a user and meet their
	emotional needs. What caused me to decline this project is that I do not feel AI has progressed far enough yet to put the mental health of
	children in its hands. Mental health is a very volatile aspect of health and if the AI made a mistake, then there could be legitimate negative
	consequences. Therefore, I decided to decline the project.</p>

      <h1>Bus Tracker</h1>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/ryan-hallock/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to Proposal</a>
      <p>This proposal is for an isp which would track school buses. With this information, it could estimate times of bus arrival, and in the event
	the bus is running late, provide new times. I considered this isp because I feel it would be extremely beneficial between the high school and
	the STEAM center. However, the issue with this project is that bus drivers could simply use the radio to communicate their
	location. Therefore, I feel the isp could be a little redundant and unnecessary.

      <h1>Cafe Project</h1>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to Proposal</a>
      <p>This project is designed so that students can pre-order lunches and therefore alleviate the issue of lunch lines. I really enjoy this idea
	because I feel it would be very beneficial to a school like Allen where the lines can last the entire lunch period. Therefore, I have greatly
	considered joining this group. In the end, I have ultimately decided to reject this isp simply because other projects interested me more. </p>

      <h1>Code Converter</h1>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/evan-ye/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to Proposal</a>
      <p>This project is to create a program that could convert a txt file from one language to another. Specifically, this project wants to begin
	with a program that could convert swift to C++. I was definitely interested in this project because I feel it would genuinely benefit a lot of
	people, even outside students. The reason I turned down this project was because I believe that some aspects of coding are entirely subjective
	and I do not believe that it is possible for people my age to accurately take that into consideration.</p>

      <h1>FreeCash</h1>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/gautam-narayan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to Proposal</a>
      <p>FreeCash is a program designed to predict stock prices and trade in order to gain a profit. It would use data from Twitter, Google, and
	r/wallstreetbets. I was interested in this project due to its use of AI. I am very interested in AI and machine learning and I feel this would
	be a great opportunity to put those concepts into practice. However, the main drawback for me is the sources where the AI would receive its
	information. Twitter is not exactly known for its trustworthiness and neither is Reddit, so I have declined this project because I believe the
	project could source its information better.

      <h1>Electronic Motorcycle</h1>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/nimrod-ohayon-rozanes/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to
	Proposal</a>
      <p>In this isp, the objective is to create an electric motorcycle from the frame of a 2002 Kawasaki ninja. I considered this proposal because I
	thought all of the physical aspects of building the motorcycle would be extremely enjoyable and the final project would be extremely
	satisfying. I feel the isp is extremely ambitious, maybe to a fault, but that just makes me more interested. However, I have decided to turn
	this project down because I would prefer an isp that is more software based, for I believe it would better prepare me for the future.

	  <h1>Screen Privacy</h1>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to Proposal</a>
      <p>This ISP is designed to fight the issue of privacy on screens in real life by detecting when others look at your screen and turning it off in
	response. I really like this project because I feel it’s fun, unique, and I would enjoy working with facial recognition. For me, the main
	drawback is the response to other people looking at your screen; I believe it would be more inconvenient for me if my screen started turning
	off while I was using it.

      <h1>Dx3</h1>
      <a href="https://codermerlin.com/users/william-clymire/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to Proposal</a>
      <p>Dx3 is a project designed to help combat drowsiness and keep the user awake. It works by using facial tracking to determine whether or not
	the user is awake. If Dx3 determines that the user has fallen asleep, it supplies them with a stimulus such as music, a buzzer, or a small
	electrical shock. I really enjoy the idea of this project and I feel it is very unique. Additionally, I feel the facial recognition aspects
	would challange me and I would greatly enjoy it. Although I very much enjoy the idea of this project, I feel others could be more practical
	and useful in the real world.

      <h1>Automatic Attendance</h1>
      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/cameron-farley/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Link to Proposal</a>
      <p>The goal of this project is to use facial recognition to recognize faces and automatically record them for attendance. It aims to increase
	classroom efficiency by cutting out unnecessary time spent doing attendance. Moreover, it could solve the issues of human error and false
	absences for attedance purposes. Overall, I really enjoy this project. Again, I enjoy the aspects of using facial recognition in the isp. The
	main draw for me is the fact that I would have to make the project differentiate between faces and be able to associate them with correct
	names. I have chosen this project because I believe it would challange me, I would enjoy it, and it could be legitimately useful in the real
	world.</p>
