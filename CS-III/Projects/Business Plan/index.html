	  <h1>Problem</h1>
	  <p>Currently, one of the greatest problems within humanity is staying awake. A study executed
	    by the AAA Foundation estimated that 100,000 police-reported, drowsy-driving crashes result in
	    about 800 deaths and about 50,000 injuries each year. Drowsy driving affects everyone and
	    greatly impairs both motor control as well as reaction speeds. Furthermore, students in the
	    modern day often fall asleep in lectures and miss out on important information.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="topicBox">
	  <h1>Solution</h1>
	  <p>Dx3 will aid in keeping its user awake during important activities and in times of
	    need. Firstly, Dx3 works by tracking the user's fave and facial expressions. By tracking the
	    user's eyes, Dx3 can determine how long the user's eyes have been closed. If the user's eyes
	    are closed for an extended period of time, Dx3 will detect that the user has become drowsy and
	    is falling asleep. Then, Dx3 will activate to help awaken the user with a user-chosen
	    deterrent. Deterrents range from music, sirens, a small vibration, or a small electric
	    shock. Once Dx3 determines that the user is sufficiently awake, it will return to a stand-by
	    mode.</p>
	  
	  <p>If the user is repeatedly falling asleep, Dx3 will prompt its user to brew a cup of
	    coffee. If the user accepts through either voice command, button, or mobile app, Dx3 will
	    produce said coffee in a linked device.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="topicBox">
	  <h1>Target Market</h1>
	  <p>Students - A student doing homework late at night or struggling to remain awake during
	    class would make great use of Dx3.</p>
	  
	  <p>Teacher - Teachers could easily use Dx3 to keep their students productive and awake.</p>
	  
	  <p>Truckers - Driving long distances can be a tired, monotonous task, so this product would
	    help users by helping them push through the long nights</p>
	  
	</div>

	<div class="topicBox">
	  <h1>Marketing Activities</h1>
	  <p> Recently trends have showed that in website video stream ads preform worse than static ads
	    that appears on the border of websites. To utilize google ads we must create a visually
	    appealing add that isn’t too flashy but persuasive enough to increase click rate.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    TikTok ads - After assessing the marketing and ads that go into tiktok, the most profitable
	    method would be through sponsoring and authenticity while also making an account that has an
	    influential platform. Products tend to do better when a consumer can not only be fond of the
	    product, but also the company behind it.
	    <br>
	    <br>
	    Instagram ads - People love to support student led projects and business and like to be
	    updated on what is happening with them currently. Instagram could provide as the medium for
	    that as we can document the creative process also give a behind the scenes detail about the
	    group and the project. This builds a more committed consumer base and tends to gain
	    attraction with others taking inspiration from a successful group.

	  <h1>Competition</h1>
	  <p>Apps such as Awake, Stay Awake, and Driver alarm are products that serve a very similar
	    purpose except they are more focused on drowsy driving. But the drawbacks to there products
	    are some don’t even use facial recognition, much of there software is outdated and buggy,
	    and the apps don’t over a good enough stimulant or incentive to stay awake.</p>
	  <p>Dx3 will be different from our competitors because not only will we make a
	    physical/auidtory stimulant to keep our users awake, we will also provide incentives and
	    helpful tips on what to do to prevent drowsiness. Many apps with smiliar premises only
	    scratch the surface, while DDD will hit the ground running.

	  <h1>Milestones</h1>
	  <p>The first milestone is to make a beta version of the app that works and is in align with
	    our goal. Second we want this product to feel more professional by creating a professional
	    looking website to go with our product. Another goal of ours is for are product to be as
	    transparent as possible by allwoing for feedback and tips for improving our product. Next,
	    implementing the stimulants and incetives as well as a working band to provide as the output
	    is the goal.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="topicBox">
	  <h1>Revenue Steams</h1>
	  <p>Dx3 will sell directly to customers from an online page and/or amazon page. Our online page
	    will contain information about our product, a place for customer feedback, and an FAQ, along
	    with much more information. To have a successful launch, a marketing campaign or general ad
	    promotion would help make our product more successful.</p>
