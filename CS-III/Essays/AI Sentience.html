	  <h1>Debates on AI: A Breakdown of the Current Position of AI</h1> 
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    Recent breakthroughs in technology have led to a large
	    increase in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). We
	    are currently in a period of rapid growth for AI, so more people
	    have begun to notice and take stances on it. Disputes have arisen
	    on whether AI should be pursued and improved on. While many fear
	    the implementation of artificial intelligence in the daily world,
	    abandoning AI will only inhibit humanity’s growth. </p>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">	  It is said that mankind is “... in a golden age of progress in artificial intelligence” so it is important
	    that we understand the risks and take artificial
	    intelligence seriously (“We need to talk about how good
	    A.I. is getting”, 2022). As it currently stands, AI will
	    become a reality whether or not people want it, for the
	    idea is simply too seductive and tempting for
	    humanity. Therefore, the best course of action is to
	    ensure that AI is developed ethically and in a way that
	    most benefits the world.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h1>The Future Draws Near: Will AI Ever be Sentient?</h1>
	  <p  class="p1Container p1Style">
	    Years ago, AI struggled with the most rudimentary of
	    tasks. Chatbots, perhaps one of the simplest forms of AI,
	    could barely create a functioning conversation. Now, large
	    language models like “...OpenAI’s GPT-3 are being used to
	    write screenplays, compose marketing emails, and develop
	    video games” (“We need to talk about how good A.I. is
	    getting”, 2022). With each year, AI is improvising at an
	    exponential rate. Additionally, fewer experts are
	    confidently predicting “...that we have years or even
	    decades to prepare for a wave of world-changing AI...”(“We
	    need to talk about how good A.I. is getting”, 2022). The
	    future is upon mankind, and it is up to society to deal with
	    how AI will be handled.</p>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">	  
	    Sentience is defined as … For AI to be truly sentient, it
	    needs to be able to recreate the human mind. This means that
	    rather than simply using data to complete tasks, it would
	    need to be able to think autonomously, feel, and most
	    importantly, learn on its own. Moreover, the machine would
	    need to be self-aware and AI would be aware of itself and
	    able to perceive its internal states and emotions. At the
	    current moment, some AI can mimic human intelligence through
	    methods like speech algorithms. However, no AI has yet to be
	    fully sentient. Recently, some AI programs have begun to
	    “learn” by “‘...extracting statistical patterns from large
	    data sets…’” and adapting based on said patterns to perform
	    tasks such as writing speeches (“A.I. is not sentient. why
	    do people say it is?”, 2022). However, the science is not
	    perfect and errors are frequent, and whether or not this is
	    an example of sentience is highly subjective. Either way,
	    this type of learning is a step in the direction of AI
	    sentience; therefore, AI will be sentient someday in the
	    future.
	  </p>

	  <h1>Utopia: How AI will Improve the World</h1>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    Unknown to most of the world, artificial intelligence is
	    already being utilized every day. For instance, AI is
	    currently used in air traffic control; to determine the most
	    efficient methods to manage and guide planes, but air
	    traffic control is only scratching the surface of the
	    capability of AI. Because artificial intelligence can
	    perform arithmetic at a pace completely infeasible to
	    humans, implementing AI into the world will greatly increase
	    efficiency.</p>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style"> 
	    For instance, artificial intelligence could be
	    used to bolster the economy. One of the main controversies
	    of machine learning stems from the fear that the automation
	    of joblessness will result in unemployment. While AI does
	    indeed render some jobs obsolete and displaces labor in the
	    short term through what is known as “creative destruction”,
	    “...robots can never reduce the number of jobs
	    overall…”(Newhard, 2017). Essentially, workers are only
	    replaced by machines when it is monetarily efficient to do
	    so, and thus replacement results in a greater output of
	    goods at a lower cost. Then, the price of final goods is
	    driven down “...increasing the real wages of everyone who
	    consumes these goods…”, freeing up cash to be spent
	    elsewhere, effectively boosting labor needs in other
	    industries (Newhard, 2017). As a result, job opportunities
	    are provided to previously displaced workers, so while it
	    may seem as though computers will destroy jobs, they will
	    simply create job opportunities elsewhere. Throughout
	    history, automation has always led to both more jobs and
	    higher living standards, so it is safe to predict that the
	    same trend will occur.</p>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style"> 
	    In addition to bolstering the
	    economy, AI will also benefit the world by improving
	    medicine. Due to modern science, it has been determined that
	    cancer is not one disease but rather hundreds of thousands
	    of rare diseases working together. Therefore, each tumor is,
	    at least to some extent, unique and the same treatments
	    cannot work for each patient (Tenenbaum and Shrager,
	    2011). To combat this, web-based rapid-learning communities
	    are growing to better combat cancer. In these web-based
	    communities, AI is used to sift incredibly fast through data
	    and plan “...thousands of complex, multistep treatment
	    strategies that ethically balance the needs of the
	    individual…” in an attempt to save their life (Tenebaum and
	    Shrager, 2011). Artificial intelligence can detect patterns
	    across multiple cases and determine the perfect,
	    individualized treatment plan for each patient. Moreover, AI
	    can provide transparency for doctors to check the merit and
	    validity of the treatment as a failsafe. Cancer treatment is
	    only a small portion of the many things AI can do for
	    medicine. Overall, artificial intelligence can bring on an
	    era of individualized medical treatment plans which can
	    greatly improve the effectiveness of medicine; therefore, AI
	    will lead humanity into a utopia.
	  </p>

	  <h1> What this Means: How AI will be Mankind's Savior</h1>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    Although many attributes of AI may seem frightening
	    such as the automation of jobs, abandoning AI would
	    greatly hinder society. Through machine learning and
	    artificial intelligence, humanity will be improved through
	    its increased efficiency, bolstered economy, and medicinal
	    growth. At the rate that AI is advancing, it is only a
	    matter of years before AI is a reality. If executed
	    correctly, it will propel humanity forward and
	    revolutionize the world, creating a utopia.
