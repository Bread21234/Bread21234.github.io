	  <h1 class="subHeaders">Bias: The Unstoppable Force</h1>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    Compare bias to infestation. In every decision a human makes, there is some type of
	    bias. Whether said bias comes from logical reasoning or superstition varies, but one
	    thing remains true; there is no such thing as an unbiased decision. While bias is
	    neither good nor bad, it is important that each person recognizes how susceptible they
	    are so that they may improve their own decision making. I am not exempt from this as I
	    am also subject to extreme bias at times. In relation to the computer science ISP, I
	    believe that although my group members and I will attempt to control our bias, we will
	    subconsciously lean towards certain ideas more than others. Specifically, the biases
	    that will cause the most impact in the project will be complexity, the illusion of
	    control, confirmation, survivorship, and Ikea effect biases.
	  </p>
	  <h1 class="subHeaders">Complexity</h1>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    Firstly, complexity bias will have a massive impact on myself and how the project
	    commences. Complexity bias is what occurs when time pressure, large quantities of
	    information, and other stressors cause an individual to perceive a task as more complex
	    than it is, interfering with their decision making. There is a “...relationship of task
	    stress to decision quality called the Yerkes-Dawson Law”(Arnott 7). For us, the best
	    choice to avoid too much complexity bias is by creating and fitting to a set
	    schedule. Much of complexity bias comes from stress, especially related to time
	    pressure, so the easiest way to avoid it would be to build a descriptive gantt
	    chart. This way, we can stay on time and not feel as overwhelmed by an approaching due
	    date.
	  </p>
	  <h1 class="subHeaders">Control</h1>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    In addition to complexity bias, the illusion of control bias will also play a big part
	    in this project. The illusion of control bias is the human tendency to believe they have
	    control over a situation which impacts their decision making. In the context of the ISP,
	    our rigorous planning can introduce control bias. Because we make the schedule
	    ourselves, we have the illusion of having more control over the assignment than we
	    do. As a result, we may feel more relaxed, hindering our decision making. We can
	    overcome this bias by acknowledging how much work we have to do and making sure we
	    properly assess what we have control over and what we do not.
	  </p>
	  <h1 class="subHeaders">Confirmation</h1>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    Personally, I believe confirmation bias will have one of the greatest impacts on our
	    decision making than some of the other biases. Confirmation bias is a bias that occurs
	    when “‘...decision makers seek confirmatory evidence and exclude search for
	    discomforting information’”(Arnott 7). Essentially, people avoid displeasing information
	    in favor of information that supports what they already believe. For the ISP, the most
	    confirmation bias will occur when a new idea challenges the work we have already done
	    and may require us to redo parts. In order to avoid having to remake parts of the
	    project, confirmation bias will kick in and interfere with our decision making. Our best
	    way of avoiding this bias is to have a project manager who is willing to make the tough
	    decisions even when it means more work for the group.
	  </p>
	  <h1 class="subHeaders">Survivorship</h1>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    Perhaps the most persistent and obscure bias affecting the project will be survivorship
	    bias. Survivorship bias is what occurs when people pay “...too much attention to
	    success, while glossing over failures”(Timely). As a result, people often become overly
	    optimistic and underestimate what is left to be done. This could affect the ISP by
	    making us focus too much on our small successes rather than looking at the bigger
	    picture. It is easy to get carried away in the progress that we make to the point where
	    we neglect what still needs to be fixed and/or completed. In order to counteract
	    survivorship bias, we can “...always consider pessimistic viewpoints…” in order to
	    gather the most accurate idea of our progress (Timely).  Perhaps the most persistent and
	    obscure bias affecting the project will be survivorship bias. Survivorship bias is what
	    occurs when people pay “...too much attention to success, while glossing over
	    failures”(Timely). As a result, people often become overly optimistic and underestimate
	    what is left to be done. This could affect the ISP by making us focus too much on our

	    fixed and/or completed. In order to counteract survivorship bias, we can “...always
	    consider pessimistic viewpoints…” in order to gather the most accurate idea of our
	    progress (Timely).
	  </p>
	  <h1 class="subHeaders">Ikea Effect</h1>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    Along with survivorship bias, another obscure bias that could have vastly detrimental
	    effects is known as the Ikea effect. The Ikea effect is known as the effect which causes
	    one to place more value on the work they have done themself, “...often while discounting
	    other people’s smart ideas or good work”(Timely) In the context of the ISP, this bias is
	    extremely dangerous as it can easily lead to infighting if we each value our own ideas
	    more than those of our peers (Ikea Effect). In order to counter it, the best option is
	    to seek a second opinion from another member in order to easily settle the dispute, both
	    alleviating tension and increasing the effectiveness of decision making. Along with

	  </p>
	  <h1 class="subHeaders">Why Does it Matter?</h1>
	  <p class="p1Container p1Style">
	    No matter how hard we try, it is impossible to eradicate all bias. However, that does
	    not mean we should simply let it control our decision making. Instead, it is important
	    that we understand each of the biases that affect us so that we may act accordingly to
	    fight against them. The computer science ISP is a long project that will require many
	    decisions, so it is important that we take into consideration how biases such as
	    complexity, the illusion of control, confirmation, survivorship, and the Ikea effect
	    will affect each member of the group.
