    <div class="contentFlex">
      <p1 class="topics topicsFlex">This portfolio is extremely important to me. Everything that I put in here represents all of the time, commitment, and work I devoted to computer science I, II, and III. Beyond that, I depicts my journey as a computer science and how I became familiar with a passion of mine. This portfolio will help me show off my projects and hopefully my growth as the year goes by.
