      <h1>Concept:</h1>
      <p1>The goal of my team's isp was to create a 2D bullet-hell rogue like. In the game, the player would traverse a map of randomly generated rooms, fighting enemies and obtaining items along the way. We themed our game around the underworld and the player's decent into hell.

      <h1>Motivation:</h1>
      <p1>Most of the motivation came from my group's love of the genre. I spent many hours in a game called "Enter the Gungeon" and it inspired me to build this isp. Additionally, creating a videogame has always been a dream of mine, so I was excited to get a chance.
